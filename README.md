# Meaningful Data
#### Graphs built with ng2-charts and d3 to represent Seattle police officer involved shooting data

#### By _**Katherine Matthews**_, 07.28.2017

## Description

_Single page website with dynamic graphs that represent Seattle's office involved shootings data. Application gathers information from Socrata's open data table and posts into postgresql database. User can choose fields to update charts dynamically on the page. One of the main goals of this project is to use data visualization to allow user to interact with data in a non-partisan way._

## Technologies Used

* _Angular2_
* _PostgreSQL_
* _Express_
* _Node_

## Expansion Ideas
- Check for updates to Socrata data automatically everyday at a certain time and if the info has changed, update psql database
- Use Watson to interpret officer involved shootings summaries. How neutral is summary? How does this change over time?
- Rebuild first two graphs with d3 and outside of Angular framework. Maybe with plain JavaScript or React
